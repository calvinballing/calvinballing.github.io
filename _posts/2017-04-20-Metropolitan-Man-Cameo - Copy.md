I have a bit part playing the lead juror in [Chapter 13: A Vast and Terryifying Enemy: part 2](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/episodes/MM_Ep_13.mp3) of the [audio production of The Metropolitan Man](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705), produced by Eneasz Brodski. The story is originally written by Alexander Wales, and can be found on [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man).  This rationalist fiction wonders what might be going through the mind of Lex Luthor in the Metropolis Universe.  This would be interesting on its own, even if Lex were not a compelling rationalist figure, who invites the reader to consider whether they ought to feel morally compelled to pursue a course of action marking them as a 'super-villan'.
