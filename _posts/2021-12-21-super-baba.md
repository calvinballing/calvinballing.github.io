I've been playing around with *Baba is You*'s [level editor](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-is-you-level-editor-beta), and decided to do a quarter-scale remake of *Super Mario Bros World 1-1*.

It has most of the features of the original level including:
 - Goombas
 - Koopa
 - Coin blocks
 - "Infinite" coin block
 - Power-up mushrooms
 - Invincibility Star
 - Secret 1-Up block
 - Falling Level Flag
 - Warp Pipe

 The only things it doesn't have are points and the extra room when going through the warp pipe shortcut.

 Unfortunately, adding all of these features makes the level super laggy. The blue background also makes it challenging, since there are only three layers in the editor, and the background takes up one. If you have any tips for reduced-lag custom Baba levels, I'm all ears!

 To give a sense of what programming it looks like, here's a look at one of the three layers from the level editor:
