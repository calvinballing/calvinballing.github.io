# What are all the keywords for the new Google Calendar Android app that will generate those beautiful images in the agenda view?

[Originally written for Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-keywords-for-the-new-Google-Calendar-Android-app-that-will-generate-those-beautiful-images-in-the-agenda-view/answer/Jim-Hays), modified slightly for this format.

\
Another Quora user (Matúš Koprda) answered the above Quora question, and provided instructions on how to generate the list of keywords to replicate the process. However, that answer was written 4 years ago, and since that time the list of flairs has almost doubled. I followed Matúš's steps to extract the updated list of English keyword strings that generate flair. The first item in each line is the flair's ID, followed by the keyword strings that trigger the matching flair.

A few fun tidbits I noticed while working on this:
1. Now, since only one flair is ever selected... how to handle collisions?  When starting this project, I was hoping for a juicy scoop about the importance ranking of holidays according to Google.  Unfortunately, the results were much less dramatic, as they are based instead on word count, keyword order, and re-use of substrings across multiple keyword.
 - If part of a keyword string is used for multiple flairs, that keyword string has priority over keyword strings that don’t. So “Clean the house for the Christmas Party” will resolve to **xmasparty** because “Christmas Party” has the word “Christmas” (which is also part of a keyword string for **xmas**) while “Clean the house” does not have any “ambiguous” words.
 - If the keyword strings have equal priority regarding the above, resolve to the keyword string with more words. So “Yoga on Valentines Day” will use **valentinesday** because “Yoga” is 1 word and “Valentines Day” is 2 words.
 - If the keyword strings still have equal priority, use the first one listed, so “Take a Nap after Soccer” will be **sleep** not **soccer** because “Nap” comes before “Soccer” in the event title
2. There are some other flairs that use the same pattern that can’t be triggered with any keyword strings.
 - [**birthday**](https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_birthday.jpg) (triggered by the Birthday calendar)
 - [**chores**](https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_chores.jpg) (?)
 - [**newyear**](https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_newyear.jpg) (deprecated in favor of **genericnewyear**)
 - [**skiing**](https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_skiing.jpg), (deprecated in favor of **skiing2**)
 - [**theateropera**](https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_theateropera.jpg), (alternate spelling of **theatreopera**)
 - [**violin**](https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_violin.jpg), (deprecated in favor of **violin2**)
3. “runs” was removed as a keyword string for **running**
4. Aside from being case-insensitive, the keyword strings require an exact match. For example, “St Patrick’s” will not trigger **saintpatricksday** because it uses the wrong apostrophe.
