Each Spring for the past few years, a group of fairy doors has mysteriously appeared in one of our local parks in the same location.  Based on the construction materials the fairies use, it looks like the fairies are perhaps recieving some help from an art class at a local elementary school.


It seemed unlikely the fairy doors would appear on their own this year given the pandemic, so our house decided to provide some of our own.  In early April we helped the fairies out with their doors, a few weeks later we returned to add a mailbox, and found that the fairies had mysteriously made themselves at home with many more lawn ornaments, and even a white picket fence!
