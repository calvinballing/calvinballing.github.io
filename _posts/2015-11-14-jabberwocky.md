First there was [xkcd](xkcd.com)'s [Up Goer Five](https://xkcd.com/1133/) picture joke using only the ten Hundred words people say the most.  Then came the [Thing Explainer](https://blog.xkcd.com/2015/05/13/new-book-thing-explainer/) book. Eventually there was a [computer word checker](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/).  My own take on using the computer word checker is farther down:

```
Was bell-leg, and the slightly droves
Did guy and game-ball in the wake:
All mom-see were the bar-oh-goes,      
And the mom-wraps out-greyed.

Watch out for Job-or-walk, my boy!      
The mouth that bites, fingers that catch! 
Look out for Job-Job flies. Avoid
The through-me-us Band-or-snap!

He took his pointed stick in hand;
Long time the man-some jerk he chased
So rested he by the Time-time tree      
And stood a while in place.

And, as in office place he stood,      
The Job-or-walk, with burning eyes,
Came wife-long through the told-she wood,      
And bar-build out its cries!

One, two! One, two! And through and through      
The pointed stick went sick-attack
He left it dead, and with its head
He went glad-something back.

And have you killed the Job-or-walk?      
Come to my arms, my be-miss son!
Oh from-just day! Call-who! Call-lay!    
He laughed that it was done.

Was bell-leg, and the slightly droves
Did guy and game-ball in the wake:
All mom-see were the bar-oh-goes,      
And the mom-wraps out-greyed.
