Our family has tradition of decorating the table for Thanksiving with fall leaves.  We go on walks earlier in the year to collect them when they are falling, then dry them between textbook pages.


For Thanksgiving, we put out a plain white tablecloth, and decorate it with leaves.  Then we put a clear plastic tablecloth over the top, so the pattern isn't disturbed while we are eating.  The complexity of the pattern ebbs and flows from year to year.  While it's usually more abstract, this year we went for a more concrete design.
