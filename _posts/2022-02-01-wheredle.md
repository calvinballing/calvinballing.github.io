With the Wordle craze in full bloom, I've decided to add my own contribution, [Wheredle](https://calvinballing.github.io/wheredle/).  It's effectively the same as Wordle still guessing a five-letter word using the same answer list and dictionary, except you also have to guess **where** the word appears in a series of ten blanks. I also give one extra guess (7 instead of 6).

For more variants, see [Wordles of the World](https://rwmpelstilzchen.gitlab.io/wordles/).
