I'm not the [first](https://www.quora.com/Do-the-Lord-of-the-Rings-novels-and-films-take-place-in-a-post-apocalyptic-setting) [person](https://nerditis.com/2013/10/13/why-lord-of-the-rings-is-a-post-apocalyptic-wasteland/) to interpret the Lord of the Rings with an emphasis on the [post-apocalyptic](http://patricksatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/lord-of-rings-and-other-fantasy-as-post.html) nature.  However, I have not seen the story imagined as as taking place within our own future, [Planet of the Apes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(1968_film))-style.

It is plausible to construct a frame-story for the Lord of the Rings in which the seemingly-magical/fantastic elements have scientific/sociological/technological explanations.  Let's take a few of the specific cases.

Races
=====
Why are there different races?  Humanity was just beginning the gene-editing revolution.  Some teams focused on preparing humanity for our [future as a spacefaring civilization](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/12125/how-important-is-the-size-of-an-astronaut).  Other teams focused on [lengthening the human lifespan](http://newatlas.com/telomerase-aging-harvard-reverse-process-telomeres/17107/).  Early experiments in the latter category produced successful results, though with sterile offspring.  Further progress led to a viable species, with various races represented among the population. In addition to the baseline men, these additional experiments, in order, led to Dwarves/Hobbits, Wizards, and Orcs/Elves.  Orcs, being the darker-skinned members of this final group, have been [segregated](http://existentialcomics.com/comic/175) long enough to develop a distinct culture from the elves.

Wizards
=======
What do we know of the magic of wizards?  Gandalf really does seem to be quite an impotent wizard.  His wizardry consists of such things as reading books (a rather scientific thing to do), launching fireworks (gunpowder is not such an advanced concept, especially if you are one of the few people who spends time in a library), fighting a Balrog (potentially a pre-arranged stunt), escaping Orthanc with the help of the Eagles (we only have his word to go on here).  Keep in mind that we are told the story from the perspective of an unreliable narrator who certainly does believe in magic, and will interpret events as such.  

Saruman, who has worked together with Gandalf, also knows how to use explosives, and puts them to great effect at Helm's Deep.  

Particulars
===========
"Would you look into the mirror?"
---------------------------------
Galadriel has a powerful persona, and if she has access to a hallucinogenic drug, combining that with the [power of suggestion](https://www.aaas.org/abstract/power-suggestion-memory-manipulation) could account for the visions the main characters see.  

Ring Invisibility
-----------------
Bilbo potentially has help from Gandalf to pull off his famous party trick.  [Misdirection](http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/08/psychology-of-magic-3-critical.php) is nothing new to magicians.
