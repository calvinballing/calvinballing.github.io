For our child's second birthday, we celebrated with a bug-themed party!  Among other things, this included a bug puzzle.  The objective is to identify the bug from the emoji, which is my second contribution (after [fruit](/fruit-emoji)) to the guess-the-thing-from-the-emoji genre of puzzle.  Other entries in the genre include movies, children's books, tv shows, Halloween candy, bands, and many more.

# Puzzle

*Identify as many bugs or bug phrases as you can!*

*Note that some are true bugs, some are colloquially bugs, and some are phrases or character names including a bug.*
