For our second child's first birthday, we celebrated with a bee-themed party!  Among other things, this included a bee puzzle.  The objective is to identify the bee-related phrase from the emoji, which is my latest contribution to the guess-the-thing-from-the-emoji genre of puzzle.  I've previously made ones for [fruit](/fruit-emoji), and one for bugs.
