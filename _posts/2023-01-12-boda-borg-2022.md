## Boda Borg Columbus - 2022

As a New Years Eve tradition, this year and the past three years ([2019](/boda-borg-2019), [2020](/boda-borg-2020), [2021](/boda-borg-2021)) I've been creating Boda Borg Quests that serve as a "year-in-review" game, based on our fun experience at [Boda Borg Boston](https://www.bodaborg.com/#intro).  If you're unfamiliar with Boda Borg, see the 2019 post for a longer description.


Here were the rooms this year:

### 1 - Yeardle

Players had to complete a Wordle where the answer was something related to 2022.  As a hint, one or two emoji were provided, along with a number from 1-12, which represented the month when that thing occurred.  For example, the clue "⚽️1️⃣2️⃣" led to an answer of "QATAR" which is where the World Cup was held in December of 2022.

### 2 - Wildlife Crossing Under Construction

In the second room, players had to cross the [World's Largest Wildlife Crossing](https://www.curbed.com/2022/01/wildlife-crossing-liberty-canyon-los-angeles.html).  However, since it is currently still under construction, this added an additional complication.  The bridge had a weight limit of 400kg.  There were enough stuffed animals for two players to have animals that "weighed" 400kg, and for the rest to have animals that weighed 200kg.  A plank was provided that could bridge one side of the highway at a time.  This is a type of [River Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_crossing_puzzle) puzzle, equivalent to the first one [here](https://justpuzzles.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/river-crossing-1/).

### 3 - DART

Players simulated the [Double Asteroid Redirection Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test).  At the far side of the room was a turntable with two "asteroids" on it.  Players had to stay on the close side of the room without crossing into "space".  However, they had several small "spacecraft" (dice) that could be placed in a long half-cylinder that was suspended from the ceiling by several strings.  The strings were attached via pulleys to the side of the room where the players were. By adjusting the pulleys, players could deliver one or more satellites to hit the asteroid and adjust its path.

### Stamp

After solving all three puzzles consecutively, players could stamp the 2022 Wordle-inspired stamp into their Boda Borg passport.
