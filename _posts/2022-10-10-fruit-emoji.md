For our child's first birthday, we celebrated with a fruit-themed party!  Among other things, this included a fruit puzzle.  The objective is to identify the fruit from the emoji, which is my own contribution to the guess-the-thing-from-the-emoji genre of puzzle.  (Other entries in the genre include movies, children's books, tv shows, Halloween candy, bands, and many more)
