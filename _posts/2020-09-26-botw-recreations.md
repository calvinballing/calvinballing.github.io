I've been enjoying playing the Switch game Breath of the Wild.  As a large, open world game, there are lots of possible things to do and to explore. This has led to a number of intersting ways to play the game such as this [vegan run](https://michellewesterlaken.com/2017/05/24/breath-of-the-wild-vegan-run/).  Having played through the majority of the intended quests, I set out to make some of my own.  Here are some of the results of my attempt to recreate famous paintings inside of Breath of the Wild.
