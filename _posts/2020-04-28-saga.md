<sup>1</sup> So started saga: Supreme sentience shaped skies, secular sphere.

<sup>2</sup> Said sphere, shapeless seeming stark, shadow shrouding same's surface, saw Supreme spirit settling sphere's substance.

<sup>3</sup> So Supreme sentience said, "Synthesize starlight," so starlight suffused.

<sup>4</sup> Supreme sentience saw starlight satisfied self, so she separated starlight, shadow.

<sup>5</sup> Supreme sentience styled starlight "span," shadow she styled "stillness." So sunset sustained, sunrise sustained--surceasing starting span.

<sup>6</sup> So Supreme sentience said, "Synthesize some separation, sundering storms, surf."

<sup>7</sup> So Supreme sentience shaped said separation, sending storms skyward, sending surf sub-separation. So sufficed.

<sup>8</sup> Supreme sentience styled separation "sky." So sunset sustained, sunrise sustained--surceasing second span.

<sup>9</sup> So Supreme sentience said, â€œSub-sky surf shall synchronize, so surrounding shores show." So sufficed.

<sup>10</sup> Supreme sentience styled surrounding shores "soil," synchronized surf she styled "seas." So Supreme sentience saw said system satisfied self.

<sup>11</sup> Subsequently Supreme sentience said, "Soil shall supply scrub: seed-spawning shrubs, soily saplings sustaining seeded sweets, separately speciated." So sufficed.

<sup>12</sup> So soil supplied scrub: seed-spawning shrubs speciated separately, saplings spawning seeded sweets speciated separately. So Supreme sentience saw said system satisfied self.

<sup>13</sup> So sunset sustained, sunrise sustained--surceasing subsequent span.

<sup>14</sup> So Supreme sentience said, "Synthesize sunshine spanning sky's separation, severing span, stillness, so shall same stars signify seasons, spans, stages, so shall sky-strewn stars supply secular sphere's sunshine. So sufficed.

<sup>15</sup> Supreme sentience shaped superlative stars--Sol: superior star supervising span, Satellite: secondary star supervising stillness. She subsequently shaped scoreless smaller stars.

<sup>16</sup> Supreme sentience suspended said stars spinning supernally, supplying secular sphere's sunshine, supervising span, stillness, separating sunshine, shadow. So Supreme sentience saw said system satisfied self.

<sup>17</sup> So sunset sustained, sunrise sustained--surceasing subsequent span.

<sup>18</sup> So Supreme sentience said, "Sea swimmers shall swarm seas, sky soarers shall swoop sphere's surface, scraping sky's separation."

<sup>19</sup> So Supreme sentience systematically shaped superb swimmers, supplementing smaller surf-subsisters, separately speciated, shaping sky soarers summarily, separately speciated. So Supreme sentience saw said system satisfied self.

<sup>20</sup> Supreme sentience sanctified same, saying, "Succeed. Swell. Saturate sea surf, similarly, sky soarers shall surround sphere."

<sup>21</sup> So sunset sustained, sunrise sustained--surceasing subsequent span.

<sup>22</sup> So Supreme sentience said, "Soil shall supply swarms separately speciated: stable stock, surface scramblers, savage sorts, separately speciated." So sufficed.

<sup>23</sup> Supreme sentience shaped sundry savage sorts, sundry stable stock, sundry surface scramblers, speciated separately. So Supreme sentience saw said system satisfied self.

<sup>24</sup> Subsequently she said, "Supreme sentience shall shape simulacra sapiens, securing self-semblance, same sapiens shall supervise sea swimmers, sky soarers, stable stock, settling secular sphere, similarly supervising surface scramblers."

<sup>25</sup> So Supreme sentience shaped sapiens, securing self-semblance, shaping Supreme simulacrum she shaped sapiens; specifying sexes, she shaped sapiens.

<sup>26</sup> Supreme sentience sanctified sapiens, saying "Spread; saturate secular sphere, settling same. Supervise surf's swimmers, sky's soarers, surface's scramblers."

<sup>27</sup> Subsequently she said, "Supreme sentience supplies sapiens sundry surface-sown, seed-spawning scrub, sundry saplings supplying seeded sweets. Such shall sustain sapiens.

<sup>28</sup> Satisfying sphere's savage sorts, sky's soarers, surface's scramblers--spirited souls, summarily--Supreme sentience supplies sundry salad sustenance." So sufficed.

<sup>29</sup> Supreme sentience surveyed system she shaped, sensing surpassing satisfaction. So sunset sustained, sunrise sustained--surceasing sixth span.

<sup>30</sup> So skies, secular sphere, secured spacious shapes systematically.
Starting seventh span Supreme sentience sealed said systems she shaped; so she spent seventh span savoring same. 

<sup>31</sup> Subsequently Supreme sentience sanctified seventh span solemnizing Sabbath, since she spent said span savoring satisfying systems.
