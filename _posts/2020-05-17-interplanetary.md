## Interplanetary - A Scale Model of the Solar System

We've planted a new letterbox series in Columbus!  The [clues are posted on AtlasQuest](https://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/?boxId=316579).


In it, you can experience a to-scale model of the solar system over the course of a two-thirds of a mile walk along the Scioto River Greenway. The size of the sun, each planet stamp, and the distance between each planet stamp and the sun are to scale.

In our model, the sun is a sculpture [commemorating victims of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Their_Spirits_Circle_the_Earth).

At this scale, you can go much faster than the speed of light, which would be just one sixth of a mile per hour!  The letterboxes are all microboxes, with stamps but no logbooks, except for Jupiter, which is the main letterbox.

*Keith's Think Zone* was enormously helpful in laying out the locations and determining the correct sizes for the stamps.  You can see how I used it in this [overlay the planets' orbits on Columbus](https://thinkzone.wlonk.com/SS/SolarSystemModel.php?obj=Sun&dia=34cm&lat=39.963806&lon=-83.006115&table=y&map=y&us=y&rings=y&moons=y&minmax=y) or you can see what the solar system would look like laid out at any scale and location you would like!
