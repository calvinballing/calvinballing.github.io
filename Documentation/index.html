            <h1 id="twister---an-introduction">Twister - An Introduction</h1>

<p>Twister is a powerful jekyll theme. </p>

<p>We don’t want to babble about how awesome jekyll is, since you already know that. In this documentation we will introduce you to the world of twister. A world in which you have all  the functionality you might have used in a previous WordPress blog or dreamt of when using Blogger. Additionally, it’s fast. Like really fast. Lightning kind of fast in comparison to some of those bloated sites, because it’s basically just static HTML. Fast, secure and really convenient, as there is no annoying WYSIWYG editor, that pretends to give you a sleek layout but actually is some really messed up code. My fellow HTML friends will know what I’m talking about. Jekyll posts are written in markdown. It feels natural and produces some pretty nice (and correct!) code.</p>

<p><br /><br />
Twister comes with a variety of different post types, which make it suitable for a lot of different sites. It is easy to use once you set up everything and all you have to do is write some markdown, run a max of three grunt commands and you are good to go.</p>

<p><br /><br />
Let us guide you through the basic set up.</p>

<p>Also make sure to scroll all the way till the end, as we’ve added some extra goodies for you to make creating posts even more of a breeze.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="reqs" class="h1">
            <h1 id="dependences">Dependences</h1>

<p>Jekyll is awesome, but it has quite a few requirements.</p>

<p>Before going on, you will need to install a few things. We’ll just link you to the docs, because they do a pretty good job, most of the time.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Git</strong><br />
if you plan on using this theme on your own server and don’t like version control (we sincerely hope that is not the case, version control is awesome!) this is not required:<br />
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Installing Git</a><br />
You also wanna <a href="https://github.com/">sign up on GitHub</a>, if you want to host there. </li>
  <li><strong>Sass</strong><br />
Sass is the preprocessor of our choice. We write all of our stylesheets in it. Because it’s fast, sassy and awesome!<br />
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/install">Installing Sass</a></li>
  <li><strong>Grunt</strong><br />
Grunt makes our life easier. We use it to serve our jekyll, minify and concatenate our javascript, compile our Sass, prefix the CSS and deploy the site to GitHub. “Making our life easier” not even closely describes how vital the job is, grunt carries out for us. You’ll see.<br />
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">Installing Grunt</a></li>
  <li><strong>jekyll</strong><br />
Of course, nothing could happen without the star of the show.<br />
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Installing jekyll</a></li>
</ol>

<p>In order for Sass, grunt and jekyll to work you need <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/"><strong>Ruby</strong></a>, <a href="https://rubygems.org/pages/download"><strong>RubyGems</strong></a> as well as <a href="http://nodejs.org/"><strong>NodeJS</strong></a> installed.</p>

<p>For the liverefresh, you will need livereload for your browser of choice. (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livereload/?src=userprofile">Firefox</a> • <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei">Chrome</a> if your browser of choice is something other than that: make a new choice, a better one (okay, <a href="https://addons.opera.com/de/extensions/details/livereload-201-beta/?display=en">Opera</a> is allowed as well…))</p>

<p>Once you’ve mastered all of those installations, the rest will be a piece of cake.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="su" class="h1">
            <h1 id="set-up">Set Up</h1>

<p>As soon as you have all of the dependences installed, you are ready to set up your site.</p>

<p>Create a new folder and copy our demo site into this folder. Open the folder in your favorite editor (ours is <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>) to check out the files and make the necessary changes.</p>

<p>Other than the editor you will need a browser and a terminal. Don’t be scared, the terminal is here to help you.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="grunt" class="h2">
            <h2 id="grunt">Grunt</h2>
<p>We use grunt with twister, because it saves us a lot of tedious steps. As you can see, all of the node-modules we used are in a folder and the theme you got comes with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">gruntfile.js</code>. So other than installing grunt, you don’t have to go through any additional steps.</p>

<p>In the following section we’ll quickly go over the three main grunt tasks we’ve created and what each of them does.<br />
<br /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>grunt serve
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This command will get a server running. Basically it executes the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> command.</p>

<p>So, to get the site running, you will need to open a terminal window in your website folder location and type this command. The server will start and you will be able to see the page at <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a></p>

<p>The terminal window you use, will then be blocked for typing. You will need to open another one for the next command. (tip: if you are on a windows machine and hate to retype your file path, add start before the grunt command and it will be executed in a new window, without affecting the current cmd)<br />
<br /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>grunt
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is the default task, which is the watch task.</p>

<p>Once you got your server up and running, you can start grunt. It will watch over your files for changes and make sure, that your site will always be up to date. With liveReload enabled your browser also updates, as soon as the site is rebuilt. Can we have a hip hip hooray for not having to vigorously hit the F5 button anymore? (Hip Hip - HORRAY!)<br />
<br /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>grunt deploy
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you are not hosting on GitHub or decide to run Twister without plugins you won’t need this task. It takes care of deployment for a site hosted on GitHub with plugins. We’ll come to that later<sup>[<a href="#yp">7.4</a>]</sup>.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="config" class="h2">
            <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Okay, now enough of installations and setups, let’s get working on your site.</p>

<p>We start off with one of the most important files in the theme - if not <em>the</em> most important file. <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></p>

<p>This file sets all of the jekyll configurations and global variables.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="sets" class="h3">
            <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>In the following section we’ll go over the variables settings.</p>

<p>First of all you want to set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> of your site, as well as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">description</code>, kinda like your tagline.</p>

<p>Then there are <code class="highlighter-rouge">url</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">url</code> is mostly just for the rss feed, so just add the url here for that. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code> is used only if you’re site is in a subfolder. Then you want to add this folder name in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code>.<br />
So as example, if your github username is <code class="highlighter-rouge">user</code> and the project this site lives in is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code> you would fill the variables as follows (the address of the site would then be: http://user.github.io/project )</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">http://user.github.io</span>
<span class="s">baseurl</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/project</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you set up a custom domain, you will need to adjust this setting to your custom domain, not the underlying GitHub address.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<strong>Some of the variables with their default settings and comments explained</strong></p>

        <section id="dir" class="h3">
            <h3 id="directories">Directories</h3>
<p>These variables handle the folder structure.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">media_folder</code> is the place where all of the images are stored (featured images, galleries etc.) By default it’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/img</code>, this is where the current media lives (all of the demo posts’ images etc.) if you want to change that, make sure this folder actually exists and your files are placed in the correct folder.</p>

<p>The other variables handle URLs. The folders in which tags, categories and author pages will be placed.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">tag_dir</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/tag</span>
<span class="s">category_dir</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/category</span>

        <section id="sm" class="h3">
            <h3 id="social-media">Social Media</h3>

<p>This is where you can place all of your social media accounts. If you remove the variable, it will vanish from the main menu. Just place the URLs here and the social media icons in the navigation will take you to the provided link when clicked.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">tumblr</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">#"</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="authors" class="h3">
            <h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>
<p>This setting is only relevant for a site with multiple authors. If you don’t want to have any author information, just make sure not to put any author variable in your front matter and nothing should show up.</p>

<p>For everyone else, here is how you set up multiple authors.</p>

<p>First you want to open <code class="highlighter-rouge">_data/authors.yml</code></p>

<p>This is where you set all of the information. There are quite a few available variables that will be used on the author pages in the author box.</p>

<p>All of them are optional; except the id. This is what you want to use within the post front matter, to assign a post to an author.</p>

<p>So in your post file it would look like this (of course replace id with the actual author id)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">id</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You want to make sure that the profile picture is placed within the folder you set as <code class="highlighter-rouge">media_folder</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><br /><br />
So the default variables for authors are:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span>
  <span class="s">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">someone</span>
  <span class="s">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Some Person</span>
  <span class="s">avatar</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/profile-pic.jpg</span>
  <span class="s">bio</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">this is some more information about the author.</span>
  <span class="s">facebook</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://www.facebook.com/someone</span>
  <span class="s">twitter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://twitter.com/someone</span>
  <span class="s">instagram</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">http://instagram.com/someone</span>
  <span class="s">email</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">someone@something.com</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="custom" class="h1">
            <h1 id="customization">Customization</h1>

<p>Of course customizing is endless, especially since jekyll is HTML and not PHP and people like to fiddle with HTML a lot more. We love HTML for it’s simplicity and always look forward to playing with it.</p>

<p>So yeah, we won’t go too much into detail how much you can actually make twister look different, because we like the way we designed it. But still, changing colors and adjusting the logo obviously is something you might want to change, and of course we won’t interfere with that.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="head" class="h2">
            <h2 id="header">Header</h2>

<p>The header is like a business card for your website. So we totally get that you want to add your own logo.</p>

<p>We are big fans of SVG, not because it is so scalable, but also because it is a lot easier to make your site responsive.</p>

<p>If your different versions are contained within the same format you can just remove a path with media queries. (There’s a really good post about this on codrops: <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/08/19/making-svgs-responsive-with-css/">Making SVGs Responsive with CSS</a>.)</p>

<p>If you’re logo works like ours and relies on different viewBoxes, just do it like us, throw all three svgs in there and display with media queries.</p>

<p>We are not going to cover how you should go about creating your logo. If you just want to use an image or headings, by all means, go ahead!</p>

<p>But this is about where to do your changes.</p>

<p>The main place to start would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes/header.html</code>, which is the basic outline of the upper header part, since technically the whole header contains the navbar as well.<br />
You can see that there are three includes that are our three different logo SVG’s. We like to keep them all separate, because code is always easier to handle if it’s shorter. (and if you know what a complex SVG looks like you know how quickly this stuff get’s out of hand.) We also like to extract our styling into the actual Sass, so that we save a few lines.</p>

<p><strong>Clean up your SVGs!</strong> we wrote this in bold, because it is something that we would really definitely recommend. If you see what horror illustrator or inkscape can spit out, Freddy Krüger is a teddy bear in comparison. In inkscape there is the option to save as plain svg and in illustrator you can turn off the editing capabilities. Both options get rid of a lot junk the web does not need (make sure to still save a version that you can edit.) Then just make sure to remove all of the styletags and add classes (especially for the paths that do use the same styles.) Also check that height and width attributes are gone and the viewBox is set.</p>

<p>All of those styles can be placed within <code class="highlighter-rouge">sass/partials/components/_logo.scss</code>.</p>

<p>For the right sizing, you need to adjust the padding hack, to your viewBox. So get the two last values of the viewBox and set them within <code class="highlighter-rouge">sass/partials/layout/_header.scss</code> in the padding hack mixin:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.logo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">@include</span> <span class="nd">paddinghack</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">100%</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="m">127</span><span class="mi">.27984</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="m">28</span><span class="mi">.97019</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// use your logo dimensions here
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Within the header file there are a few other steps to consider as well. You might need to adjust the classes of your elements and the media query breakpoints. Just read through it, we did add a few comments here and there to make it more understandable.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="sass" class="h2">
            <h2 id="sass">Sass</h2>

<p>Sass… we could go on and on (and on…) about how much we love this stuff, but we’ll spare you the sweet-talking and just say: it is fantastic and will save you so much time if you want to do any customization on your own. Especially on our Twister Theme.</p>

<p>We created quite a few variables and put all of the settings within <code class="highlighter-rouge">sass/partials/_base.scss</code>.</p>

<p>Here you can change as much as you want.

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="sidebar" class="h2">
            <h2 id="sidebar">Sidebar</h2>

<p>The sidebar file might also be worth a quick glance.</p>

<p>It allows you to place whatever you want.</p>

<p>Widgets follow some simple rules to process basic markup in order that styles get applied correctly</p>

<p>The file you need is <code class="highlighter-rouge">_include/sidebar.html</code> and the HTML structure for a widget looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"widget"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h3</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"title"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Widget Title<span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- your widget content --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Place your title in the h3 tag and place your content underneath your title. You can include whatever HTML you like.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="code" class="h2">
            <h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>So, now your favorite piece: The code. Of course you can customize it.<br />
Change whatever you like. The basic structure is simple.</p>

<p>We have an index layout that is used for the home page, category pages, tag pages and author pages. Category, author and tag layouts are integrated as extensions of the index page with a few restrictions. They don’t have pagination the way the home pages do, because those pages come with plugins to modify the amount of posts rendered and jekyll’s pagination feature is restricted to the full set of posts only.</p>

<p>There is one general <code class="highlighter-rouge">article_index</code> include, that styles the articles for the index pages. So we use this style across all of these sites. If you would like something a little shorter, which would make sense if you have something around 100 posts in a category, you might want to change that.</p>

<p>We wrote an alternative <code class="highlighter-rouge">article_index</code>, which displays just the title and date.</p>

<p>You do need to make two small adjustments if you want to use it. Replace the include and change the alternative index layout. This will ensure, that the index displays correctly and that the style switch vanishes.</p>

<p>So let’s give it a try, shall we?</p>

<p>Open either <code class="highlighter-rouge">_layouts/author_index.html</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">_layouts/category_index.html</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">_layouts/tag_index.html</code> (or the main <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file for that matter, if you want your homepage short as well) and find the article loop with the include: </p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">article_index</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">html</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>replace this with</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">article_index_short</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">html</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>and change the layout in the front matter from index to index_alt</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">index_alt</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This adaption will result in the short article index version, which looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/article_index_short.png" alt="article_index_short" /></p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="content" class="h1">
            <h1 id="add-content">Add content</h1>

<p>As soon as you are happy with what the site looks like, you can start to focus on what makes for a good website. The content!</p>

<p>In this section we’ll guide you through the process of filling pages and adding posts.</p>

<p>Twister got all of  fancy post types that are very useful and make for a pretty multimedia site within minutes.</p>

<p>Read on and see how easy it can be to set up your content with Twister.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="pages" class="h2">
            <h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>

<p>There are two different ways of how to add content to your site. The static one is a page.</p>

<p>Pages could just be html or markdown documents that get placed in the root directory, but if you don’t like file-endings in your URLs, create a folder and an index-file in there. The URL will then be the folder name.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="p" class="h3">
            <h3 id="standard-amp-full-width">Standard &amp; Full-Width</h3>

<p>For the pages you also use the classic jekyll front matter.</p>

<p>Here is what it looks like for one of our pages</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">page</span>
<span class="s">featimg</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">6.jpg</span>
<span class="s">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Page</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout</code> options are again <code class="highlighter-rouge">full-width</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">with sidebar</code>.</p>

<p>The version without sidebar would require the layout-value <code class="highlighter-rouge">page_full</code></p>

<p>The title is self-explanatory. Add a title  if you want your page to have like - a name (no anonymous pages out there guys, please!). You might want to make it relatable to the folder name as well. Just a tip.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">featimg</code> variable is for the featured image. It will be added above the content (and title). The image has to be within the media folder defined in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code><sup>[<a href="#dir">3.2.2</a>]</sup> file.</p>

<p>And then just go about adding your content underneath the front matter. And if it is just for writing, we highly recommend using markdown since it’s much easier and more fun to write in markdown.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="archive" class="h3">
            <h3 id="archives">Archives</h3>
<p>Archives are usually something you want to put in a page. At least we do.</p>

<p>So while we were creating the page layouts, we also created two includes that help you create archive pages.</p>

<p>To create an archive page, you would complete the same steps as you do when you make a page. Then just add one of the includes within your content.</p>

<p>There are two different archive possibilities. One of them sorts the posts by month, the other one by year. It will mostly depend on your preference (or on how many posts you write) which one of them you will want use.</p>

<p>They do work pretty similarly, though.</p>

<p>To use the archive page, just paste the include into the content section. Archives can be placed in pages or posts.</p>

<p>For an archive by month:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">monthly_archive</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">html</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>and the archive by year:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">yearly_archive</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">html</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="posts" class="h2">
            <h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>

<p>This is where your blog receives the Frankenstein lightning shocks and starts living.</p>

<p>A new post is created within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> folder and has to follow a specific naming scheme.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.FILEFORMAT

// example: 
2015-01-01-happy-new-year.md
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It starts with the front-matter, where most of the magic for our post types happen.</p>

<p>Every post has a few variable requirements. Some variables need to be integrated, some can be integrated and some are type specific. This section will go over every variable:<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>defaults</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="s">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">standard</span>
<span class="s">homedisplay</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">featimg</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These are the variables that should not change too much (you can change the defaults in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>-file <sup>[<a href="#sets">3.2.1</a>]</sup>). ]). The layout by default is with the sidebar, the post type will be standard and usually the featured image will be displayed instead of an iframe. These three are part of the required variables.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>required variables</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="s">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">standard</span>
<span class="s">homedisplay</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">featimg</span>
<span class="s">featimg</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">1.jpg</span> <span class="c1"># can be left out</span>
<span class="s">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">someone</span> <span class="c1"># leave this out if you don't want to work with authors, otherwise use author id as set within _data/authors.yml</span>
<span class="s">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post title</span> <span class="c1"># this is important</span>
<span class="s">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">describing the post</span> <span class="c1"># this will be used in the meta-tag. SEO-wise pretty important</span>
<span class="s">tags</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">tag1</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">tag2</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">tag3</span><span class="pi">]</span> <span class="c1"># tags, leave them out if you don't work with tags</span>
<span class="s">category</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">category</span><span class="pi">]</span> <span class="c1"># categories, leave out if you don't work with categories</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see here there are a few variables that are not as <em>demanded</em> as others. They are variables, that we’ve integrated to unlock Twister’s full capability. If you don’t want to use plugins, you obviously would leave out categories, tags and the author. The description is good for any Google bots (SEO), but you won’t see anything and the featured image is just there if you want to include one.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="standard" class="h3">
            <h3 id="standard">Standard</h3>

<p>The standard post type is just for plain posts.</p>

<p>It does not come with the “featured section” that we use on other types, which means the featured image is not placed above the content but after the post title.</p>

<p>A standard front matter would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The defaults are already set, so you don’t have to include them a second time.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="s">featimg</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">2.jpg</span>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="image" class="h3">
            <h3 id="image">Image</h3>
<p>For an image post, the post type needs to be changed.</p>

<p>It looks just slightly different than the standard post. The featured image is above the content since that is the main part of an image post.</p>

<p>For the image post type, obviously <code class="highlighter-rouge">featimg</code> becomes a requirement.</p>

<p>Image post type front matter:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>

        <section id="gallery" class="h3">
            <h3 id="gallery">Gallery</h3>
<p>A gallery does require a bit more work. The thing we do here is similar to a WordPress shortcode.</p>

<p>We define images and titles in a data sheet and place an <em>include</em> in the post.</p>

<p>The post does need the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gallery-id</code>, within the front matter, as well as <code class="highlighter-rouge">type: gallery</code> set.</p>

<p>There are two different options how to include the gallery. The first is a scroll-through, that places all of the images at full-width within the content. The second creates a box with thumbnails, which reveals a lightbox when clicked on and can be navigated by touch, arrow-keys or plain old mouse commands.</p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is to put your images in the media folder (we like being a little more organized and decided to create a folder called galleries within that folder and place all of the files for a gallery in there).</p>

<p>Then open up the gallery data file (<code class="highlighter-rouge">_data/galleries.yml</code>)</p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is give your gallery an id. Then set the image folder location. Integrate the full image path, including the media folder (you could have a separate folder, but then it would be less convenient for the featured image. Your call.)</p>

<p>After that, add the filenames within that folder and give the pictures a description via alttext. </p>

<p>The alttext will be used as alt within the image tags, but it will also work as a title on the classic gallery setting, or function as the caption with the lightbox.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">gallery</span>

<p>Creating a Vimeo video post is quite simple.</p>

<p>It is one of the three post types, that allows for the iframe to be on the index pages. If you decide to go with that post type, you won’t need to include a featured image, as it will not be displayed anywhere.</p>

<p>The type has to be Vimeo and then just include the embed code as well as the featured image or <code class="highlighter-rouge">homedisplay: iframe</code></p>

<p>YouTube is a little bit different from Vimeo. Since the URL structure is always the same, it is possible to draw the thumbnail picture from the video id. Therefore that’s what we decided to do.</p>

<p>Find the video ID of your video (the part of the URL after <code class="highlighter-rouge">/watch?v=VIDEOID</code>) and put that in the front matter.</p>

<p>If you leave <code class="highlighter-rouge">homedisplay</code> out, the thumbnail will be used as featured image.</p>

            <h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>An Audio post is technicalle the same as a Vimeo post. You just place the iframe embed code in the front matter. The only difference lies within the code. YouTube and Vimeo videos are responsive (they always scale within the 16:9 format) The iframe that you include via audio format, will use the dimension settings from the embed code.</p>

<p>So basically you use this option if you want to embed any kind of iframe which is not in the 16:9 format.</p>

<p>The only thing we could think of were audio embeds. Soundcloud for example.</p>

<p>Front Matter follows the same rules:</p>

<p>After your pages are set, you might as well just go ahead and work on your navigation.</p>

<p>The menu is a responsive off-canvas menu. It offers a two-level dropdown menu. Since the parent elements work as triggers, they do not allow links, so make sure to have your parent element’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">href</code> is pointing to a hashtag.</p>

<p>Otherwise it’s just your basic list.</p>

<p>Keep the toggle-links for the functionality to work.</p>

<p>The navigation is located in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes/nav.html</code></p>

<p>As you can see we did add the baseurl to our urls, so that they will work in a subfolder. If you know that your site will be served within the root folder, feel free to leave that out.</p>

            <h1 id="additional-functionality">Additional Functionality</h1>

<p>Jekyll is fantastic, but it comes with a few restrictions.</p>

<p>First and probably biggest of all is the lack of a comment function.</p>

<p>But it’s not that bad, because there are possibilities to include comments. One of the most popular comment systems, is actually just embedded through HTML and that’s the one we will use.</p>

<p>The other thing is a search function. If you don’t feel the need that your users actually utilize this function just leave it out. If you think a search function is a necessity, there are different options you can use.</p>

        <section id="comments" class="h2">
            <h2 id="comment-form">Comment Form</h2>

<p>The comment system that’s most popular is <a href="https://disqus.com/">disqus</a>.</p>

<p>You need to create an account and register your site.</p>

<p>Then access the universal code and create a new include.</p>

<p>Then include it in the layouts you want to use it with.</p>

<p>That simple.</p>

        <section id="search" class="h2">
            <h2 id="search-function">Search function</h2>

<p>When it comes to search functions, there are several different options and opinions. Some people don’t like certain search functions, others love them, etc.</p>

<p>We did include a dummy search form, jut for design purposes, in case you want to include a search function.</p>

<p>There are possibilities floating around on the internet using javascript. Another option would be to create a Google custom search.</p>

<p>We don’t set any rules or recommendations. It is totally up to you what you want to use.</p>

<p>Also, world of inter webs provides much better instructions on that matter than we could ever write.</p>

<p>When you are ready to go live, you have to think about a few things.</p>

<p>We’re gonna touch upon some of them, help you with your decision and assist you with that step into the public.</p>

        <section id="gh" class="h2">
            <h2 id="github-or-server">GitHub or Server?</h2>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> is free and it runs jekyll. Perfect. But of course you might not want to choose GitHub to host your site on.</p>

<p>A Reason for that might be, that you own a server or don’t mind paying. Or you just don’t want your page to be open sourced.</p>

<p>But Github has a downside as well. It runs jekyll in save-mode. This means no plugins. We do use plugins in Twister for category pages, tag pages and author pages. If you don’t want to use that, GitHub might work as a CMS for you. We did include support for <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>, which kinda turns it all into a pretty CMS, that looks definitely better than Blogger or WordPress. </p>

<p>If you want to use plugins, you still can host on GitHub but you will need to compile the site manually. It actually would take even more steps than just regenerating, quite a few git commands are involved. But grunt is here to save the day and you can still enjoy free hosting. It just needs a bit more time and is a little less flexible.</p>

<p>But if you are like us and never leave the house without your laptop anyway, you’re just as flexible as can be.</p>

<p>If you choose the server you will just need to compile your site and host the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder like you would do with any other HTML site.</p>

<p>If you decide to go with GitHub hosting, read on.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="yon" class="h2">
            <h2 id="plugins-yes-or-no">Plugins: Yes or No?</h2>

<p>It is a decision, an endless back and forth. Or maybe not? </p>

<p>If you want to have several people contributing on the site with plugins you will have to act as a moderator. So people can create posts on GitHub, but in order for the blog posts to go live, you will have to pull the changes, rebuild the site with grunt and push the live site back up with grunt deploy. If that is not a step you want to take, you might just sacrifice the plugins (no author pages, no category pages, no tag pages) and have new posts go live automatically.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pros and cons for every method, and the decision is personal. Even if you go without the plugins, the site will still have a lot of nice features. And the archive will still work.</p>

<p>After you’ve made a decision, you are ready to deploy.</p>

<p>If you decided to go with the plugins, skip the next section. If you go without plugins, skip the section after the next one.</p>

        <section id="np" class="h2">
            <h2 id="deploy-on-github-without-plugins">Deploy on GitHub Without Plugins</h2>

<p>Deployment without plugins is actually really easy.</p>

<p>Grab the URL you will be hosting your site on and the subfolder. If you are going to host in there and set the two variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">url</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>Put all of the files not listed below (especially the <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_modules</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folders) to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>, because you definitely won’t need those up there. If you don’t use plugins you just want to push the following files to GitHub (file in brackets means these might have changed or you might not need them)</p>

<p>When that is done, GitHub will run jekyll and serve the resulting site under the URL.</p>

<p>If you want to publish a new post, just create a new one in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory and push. Or just log into GitHub and write it directly on there.</p>

<p>This will work for new content</p>

<p>If you want to change something in your design though (new js stuff, new stylesheets, everything grunt does for you) you will have to pull it all down and run grunt again, to compile sass, run autoprefixer and uglify and merge all of the script files.</p>

        </section>
    

    
        <section id="yp" class="h2">
            <h2 id="deploy-with-plugins">Deploy with Plugins</h2>

<p>If you want to deploy with plugins, you will need to follow a few steps.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to push the built <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder with all of your other source files and then copy that site onto the main branch GitHub will serve. So in case you use the user-repository: username.github.io, you want to create a branch called source and push all of the things there. The site will then be copied into the master branch.</p>

<p>For every other repository, a branch called <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> is required.</p>

<p>If the site will be located within a subfolder, make sure to add baseurl and url (set url in any case) for the site in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><br /><br />
Now for deployment.</p>

<p>You might not want to push your <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_modules</code> folder, because it takes a lot of space and is not relevant, even if people want to check out the source.</p>

<p>But make sure that <em>under no circumstances</em>, your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder ends up on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file, because you need to build it yourself, as the jekyll GitHub runs, would end up being a save build, so no plugins.</p>

<p>The git commands you would need to execute would take quite some time, so we let grunt do the work. But we need to set that up first.</p>

<p>Open your <code class="highlighter-rouge">gruntfile.js</code> and find the following section.</p>

<p>Put your remote url here and choose to what branch the _site should be pushed to.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">buildcontrol</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">options</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="nx">push</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nx">message</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s1">'Built _site from commit %sourceCommit% on branch %sourceBranch%'</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>

        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After you did that, build your site, and commit all of your changes to the source branch. After all of your changes are commited, run the grunt command in your terminal.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>grunt deploy
</code></pre>

            <h1 id="file-name-and-front-matter-generator">File Name and Front Matter Generator</h1>

<p>And this is our little extra.</p>

<p>We know how tedious it can be to remember variable names. You wish you could just fill out some fields and have the front matter generated for you? You can have that!</p>

<p>We wrote a little generator, that does exactly that.</p>

<p>It comes in your folder and is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">file_name_and_front_matter_generator.html</code></p>

<p>Open the file in your browser, fill the form out and the generator will output the file name, with the current date and the front matter that you then can just copy and paste into your next post.</p>

<p>Or use the one below, if you prefer.</p>

<iframe src="file_name_and_front_matter_generator.html" height="900px"></iframe>

And now all that’s left for us to say is: happy blogging!</p>
